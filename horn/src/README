The Horn parser generator system.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-------- --- ----------

You will need GCC, bison, flex, and python to build, install, and run horn.

Use the standard Unix technique to configure your sources:

      ./configure --prefix=DIR

DIR defaults to $HOME if the --prefix option is left off.  This configures
so that the executable will be installed in DIR/bin and auxiliary data in
DIR/lib/horn.  Alternatively, you may set these two directories
separately with --bindir=DIR and --datadir=DIR.

The configure script uses the $PATH at the time of configuration to find 
python, bison, and flex.  The optional parameters --with-python=PROG,
--with-bison=PROG, and --with-flex=PROG will override this.

To build, use

     make

(GNU make), and to install in the selected location, use

     make install

To uninstall, use

     make uninstall
